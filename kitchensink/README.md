# ForrestJS/react KitchenSink

This kitchenSink app demonstrates how to use [ForrestJS/hooks](https://github.com/forrestjs/forrestjs/tree/master/packages/hooks) in a React application to achieve a high degree of feature isolation and composability.

FYI: This app was made with [CRA](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

## Running the App

```js
npm install
npm start
```
